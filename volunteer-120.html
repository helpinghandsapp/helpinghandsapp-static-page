        </button>
        <ul class="faq-text">
          <li>
            Yes, of course! During our 1-on-1 session, we will ask what your
            school's requirements are for volunteer activities that count
            towards community involvement hours.

          <li class="sublist">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Different schools and school boards have their own different set
                of requirements as to what count towards community involvement
                hours
              </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For example, some schools are okay to count your
                    volunteering without pay at a for-profit organization, while
                    some schools only strictly count volunteering with
                    registered charity and not-for-profit organizations.

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If you do not know what your school requires as community
                involvement hours, that is okay. We will match you with a
                not-for-profit organization or charitable cause. You can find
                your school's community involvement hour requirements by
                visiting your school or school board's website, contacting your
                school, contacting your school's guidance counselor, or they
                might have already give you a form outlining the community
                involvement hours requirements.
